## Overview

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration! This setup is designed to enhance the Neovim experience with a curated set of plugins, key mappings, and configurations that I find useful in my day-to-day coding.
It is *heavily* inspired by [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
